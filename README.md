**This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks used to conduct supplementary analyses for von Berg et al. (2020), "[Weddell Sea phytoplankton blooms modulated by sea ice variability and polynya formation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GL087954)", *Geophysical Research Letters*, doi:10.1029/2020GL087954.**

### Description:
* The Jupyter Notebook `bsose_weddell_analysis.ipynb` carries out analyses of Biogeochemical Southern Ocean State Estimate (B-SOSE) model fields described in the main text and discussed in further detail within the Supporting Information Text S1, Figure S7, and Figure S9. Specifically, the code assesses the relationship between annual net community productivity (ANCP) and ice-free season length within the Weddell Sea seasonal ice zone (SIZ), and compares ANCP over Maud Rise to ANCP within the broader Weddell Sea SIZ. Additional analyses are included that were not discussed in our study.
* The Jupyter Notebook `float_distance_check.ipynb` calculates statistics describing the distances that the Argo floats MR1, MR2, WG1, and WG2 (see text) drifted during portions of the study period.
